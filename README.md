# the application is simple, but it will be useful for those who would like to know everything about stops in Moscow.
the application consists of 3 screens, where the first is a table of stops with a search for them, the second screen contains a map and a button to return to the choice of a stop, and the last screen is a stop card with detailed information.
the application is written in MVP, data saving is implemented through UserDefaults
!!!IOS 14 SWIFT 4
I used the library to create the card, I did all the layout through XIB
